# Top Anime Archive

This project is my final poject during the multiverse bootcamp
I am focusing on using react hooks like
- useContext
- useReducer

I am planning to make a scaled down version of My Anime List and using [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) to get seasonal anime and firebase to store user and other anime/manga data.

### Some of the components I plan on having
- [x] Trending Anime
- [x] Trending Manga
- [x] Home page with 5 trending anime, 5 trending Manga, 2 reccomendations
- [x] Add login function with firebase
- [x] I would also like to incorporate functionality so a user can add or remove anime or manga on their own personal list.
- If it is a manga a user can set it to
  - [x] completed
  - [x] reading
  - [x] dropped
  - [x] to be read
- If it is an anime a user can set it to
  - [x] watched
  - [x] watching
  - [x] dropped
  - [x] to be watched

For styling I will be using a bit of reactstrap for the header/navbar and flexbox/grid for the rest

### Long term goals
- [ ] functionality so a user can change the status of anime or manga in their list
